# My approach
## Project setup

- Created a new folder named landing-page-task and opened it in VS Code using “Open Folder.”

- Added two files at the root: index.html and style.css, then linked the CSS in the HTML head.

- HTML structure (semantic layout)

- Added semantic landmarks: header, main, and footer for better structure and accessibility.

- In header, placed a logo and a nav with links (Features, About, Get Started) and a mobile menu button.

- In main, created three sections:

- hero: headline, short paragraph, and primary call-to-action button.

- features: three cards explaining Semantic HTML, Flexbox, and Grid.

- In footer, included copyright text and basic social links.

- CSS layout and styling

- Defined a color palette and base styles (box-sizing, font, background) for consistent look and feel.

- Built layout with modern CSS:

- Used CSS Grid for the hero/features sections to create responsive columns.

- Used Flexbox in header/footer and lists to align items horizontally and space them evenly.

- Added a minimal gradient background, card borders, and rounded corners for a clean visual design.

- Implemented a simple button style (primary gradient) for the CTA and a small variant for nav.

- Responsiveness and media queries

- Used the meta viewport tag to ensure proper scaling on mobile.

- Added media queries to:

- Collapse hero grid to a single column on smaller screens.

- Stack feature cards vertically on small screens.

- Convert the desktop nav into a toggle menu on mobile (hidden list that opens under the header).

- Mobile navigation toggle (tiny JavaScript)
