## Tech Stack

- HTML5 for structure and semantics.  
- CSS3 for responsive layout, gradients, and accessible focus states.
- GitHub Pages for free static hosting. 


## How It Was Built

### 1) Static site scaffolding  
- Created a minimal, semantic index.html with sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact). 
- Styled with a color gradient background,  and accessible focus rings. 

### 2) Deployment to GitHub Pages  
- Pushed files to a public repo and enabled Pages from Settings → Pages with Source: main and Folder: root.
- Opened the user site at the pattern `<Sumit-Kushwaha62>.github.io` once the build finished. 

## Getting Started 
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally with no extra tooling required. 
- Optionally use any static server or VS Code Live Server for automatic reloads during edits.



## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1) Create a public repo named `<Sumit-Kushwaha62>.github.io`.  
2) Add the project files to the repo root, commit, and push to `main`.  
3) In GitHub → Settings → Pages, set Source: “Deploy from a branch”, Branch: `main`, Folder: `/ (root)`.  
4) Wait a few minutes and then open `<Sumit-Kushwaha62>.github.io` to view the live site.  
5) Update by pushing new commits; Pages redeploys automatically.
