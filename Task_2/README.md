## Project Overview
- This project is a dynamic To-Do List and Notes Dashboard web application developed as part of a front-end internship task. The goal was to create an interactive, user-friendly interface, all built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without using any external JavaScript libraries.


## Approach and Solution
- To solve this problem effectively, the following approach was taken:

- Design & HTML Structure:

- Created a semantic, accessible structure using HTML5 elements.

- Designed using CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout to replace Bootstrap framework, ensuring responsiveness.

- Included modals for adding new notes/tasks with inputs for title and description.

### Styling (CSS):

- Developed custom CSS to mimic and enhance Bootstrapâ€™s styles such as pills navigation, cards, buttons, and modals without external CSS frameworks.

- Functionality (Vanilla JavaScript):

- Built event listeners for user actions such as clicking "Add Note", deleting notes, and filtering notes.

- Used efficient DOM traversal and manipulation methods (querySelector, classList, insertBefore etc.) to update the interface instantly.

- Created modular functions to handle different features for maintainability and scalability.

- Used modern JavaScript techniques (ES6+) for readability and performance.
